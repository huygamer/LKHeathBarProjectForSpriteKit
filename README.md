Heath Bar Project for Sprite Kit

This is created by Huygamer
LapKan Corp.

It is free to use for any project you can.
It is come with my creative.

At the basic, you create a new Sprite Node with a background, foreground and an icon. We need a crop node that can help you display what you need on the Bar.

All thing you need to do is init the heath bar with:

LKHeathBarNode * progressHeathNode = [[LKHeathBarNode alloc] initHeathBar];

Setting the new value for this Heath Bar: 

[progressHeathNode setProgress:.8f];

and done. 
This will have an action which will change the heath bar to this value.

You should use your stuff for your project.
